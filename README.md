# Compiler-of-simplified-C-language

This was made as a part of assignments given under Introduction to Language Processing(CS251) course at IIT Bhilai 2020-21 W Semester. Each of the assignments progressively reduce the features available in the language to make it feasible to implement in the stipulated time. Still important functionalities like arrays, while loop, if-else, switch case and scoping are still implemented in the final assignment
